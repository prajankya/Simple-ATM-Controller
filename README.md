## Details

Developing Bank API is out of the scope of this project but a basic API is provided in "supporting_classes".

The basic Bank API is developed to be `stateless`.

ATM Controller contains card and pin validation which may be similar to that inside Bank API, but Bank API specific validation implentation is out of the scope.
